#Matrix Multiplication using pthread

#Description This project calculate the multiplication of two matrices with three methods: 1.the normal multiplications using three for loops in matmult function. 2. using pthread and pthread_join and calculating the multiplication of each element in matmult_v1. 3. using pthread and pthread_join and calculating the multiplication of each row in matmult_v2. all this will be in the matmult.c file while the project.c generates the matrices itself.

#requirements you should install "sudo apt install g++" , "sudo apt install gcc" , "sudo apt-get install bison flex " just type "make" on the terminal to compile the project and then write ./lab6 to run it.
