# Matrix Multiplication using pthread

#Description
This project calculate the multiplication of two matrices with three methods:
 1.the normal multiplications using three for loops in matmult function.
 2. using pthread and pthread_join and calculating the multiplication of each element in matmult_v1.
 3. using pthread and pthread_join and calculating the multiplication of each row in matmult_v2.
all this will be in the matmult.c file while the project.c generates the matrices itself.

#requirements
 you should install "sudo apt install g++" , "sudo apt install gcc" , "sudo apt-get install bison flex "
 just type "make" on the terminal to compile the project and then write ./lab6 to run it.
